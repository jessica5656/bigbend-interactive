			<p class="content-text">Welcome to Big Bend Interactive. The one place you need to go to prepare for your next exciting adventure into the wild. Things have changed in all of our worlds recently and one beautiful silver lining is may of us fine ourselfs getting back to nature. Things are stressful enough, we don't think getting back to nature should be. It may have been some time since you have visited our park, you may even be visitng us for the first time. Either way welcome! We want you to feel confident and ready to explore our parks and your safety and experience matter to us. You can explore our educational videos and even get aquainted with the park virtually. We encourage you to download some maps and guidelines to help you prepare, but don't forget to look through our Ranger Preparedness stations on site for any of your last minute needs. We hope you enjoy our park.s</p>
